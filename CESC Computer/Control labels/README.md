# Control labels

This image is meant to be printed and then taped on top of the 10 segment bar graphs for the control word.
It's based on the [8bit-labels by w3arycod3r](https://github.com/w3arycod3r/8bit-labels).

**Warning**: Unlike the original labels, the size of this file isn't the real size of the bar graphs. Using "Actual size" in Adobe Reader isn't enough.
