# CESCA Documentation and tools

This repository contains the following:

## CESCA architecture:
- [**MAIN DOCUMENTATION**](https://github.com/p-rivero/CESCA/blob/master/Documentation/CESCA.pdf)
- Information about the architecture and its I/O interfaces
- Examples of some assembly programs

## CESC computer:
- Pictures of the finished build
- Schematics **(not yet)**
- Code for programming all its EEPROMs
- Code for assembing and sending programs to the Arduino RAM programmer

> *Important notice:* The used assembler is **customasm**, which you can find [here](https://github.com/hlorenzi/customasm).


**New:** `CESC16` is the improved 16-bit version of this architecture (featuring an improved instruction set, hardware interrupts and a simple OS). It can be found at [github.com/p-rivero/CESC16](https://github.com/p-rivero/CESC16).
